# DataExchangeBetweenActivities

This Android app demonstrates how to exchange data between two activities using Intent. 

It consists of two activities: MainActivity and MainActivity2. 

In MainActivity, the user enters their name into an EditText field, and upon clicking the "CLICK" button,
the input is passed to MainActivity2, where it is displayed in a TextView. Here's a brief overview of the code and how to use the app.

### How to Use the App
Launch the app, and you will see the MainActivity with an EditText field.
Enter your name into the EditText field.
Click the "CLICK" button.
You will be taken to MainActivity2, where your name will be displayed in a TextView.
